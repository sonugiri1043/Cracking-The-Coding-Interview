Dominos:
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use
the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or
showing why it's impossible).

Solution:
When we try to lay down dominoes on row 1, which only has 7 squares, we may notice that one
domino must stretch into the row 2. Then, when we try to lay down dominoes onto row 2, again
we need to stretch a domino into row 3.

For each row we place, we'll always have one domino that needs to poke into the next row.
No matter how many times and ways we try to solve this issue, we won't be able to successfully
lay down all the dominoes.

Other approach:
The chessboard initially has 32 black and 32 white squares. By removing opposite corners
(which must be the same color), we're left with 30 of one color and 32 of the other color.
Each domino we set on the board will always take up one white and one black square. Therefore,
31 dominos will take up 31 white squares and 31 black squares exactly. On this board, however,
we must have 30 black squares and 32 white squares. Hence, it is impossible.
