/*
  Missing Number:
  An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which
  is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The
  elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch
  the jth bit of A[i]," which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it
  in O(n) time?
